# cpsc453-presentation

Slides for paper presentation: "Network-based stratification of tumor
mutations." by Hofree, et al.  in CPSC453 (Computational Methods for
Biological Data).

The paper is pretty cool; essentially, they improve upon matrix factorization
techniques for soft clustering by smoothing the signal over a gene interaction
graph via random walks prior to the smoothing.  You can find the paper
at [Nature Methods](
http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v10/n11/full/nmeth.2651.html).

The style of the slides is adapted from [Taylor Arnold](
http://statsmaths.github.io/)'s [Linear Models](
http://statsmaths.github.io/stat612/) slides.
